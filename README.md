Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm 

## 1. Project description:

The project uses NSGA-II to do feature selection for machine learning algorithm.
The objective is to reduce the number of features in the dataset, 
while decreasing the classification error.

The datasets are sonar and arrhythmia, the former has approximately 40 
features and 200 instances, and the latter has over 160 features and over 2000 instance.

## 2. How to run the project:
(1) Clone the project to your machine

(2) Use "pipenv shell" to activate the virtual environment

(3) Use "pipenv install" to install all libraries

(4) Run the project. If it said "no module name pymoo", switch run option to "current file" and re-try
